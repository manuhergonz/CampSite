        <div class="caja1">
            <h2>The king (♔,♚)</h2> <br>
            <p>A king can move one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically,
                or diagonally) unless the square is already occupied by a friendly
                piece or the move would place the king in check. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="caja2">

            <h2>The queen (♕, ♛)</h2>
            <p>
                The queen can be moved any number of unoccupied squares in a straight
                line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, thus combining the moves
                of the rook and bishop. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="caja3">
            <h2>The bishop (♗,♝)</h2>
            <p>
                The bishops may be differentiated according to which wing they begin
                on, i.e. the king's bishop and queen's bishop. As a consequence of its
                diagonal movement, each bishop always remains on either the white or
                black squares, and so it is also common to refer to them as light-
                squared or dark-squared bishops. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="caja4">
            <h2>The knight (♘,♞)</h2>
            <p>
                The knight move is unusual among chess pieces. It moves to a square
                that is two squares away horizontally and one square vertically, or two
                squares vertically and one square horizontally. The complete move
                therefore looks like the letter "L". Unlike all other standard chess
                pieces, the knight can "jump over" all other pieces (of either color)
                to its destination square. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="caja5">
            <h2>The rook (♖,♜)</h2>
            <p>
                The rook moves horizontally or vertically, through any number of
                unoccupied squares (see diagram).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="caja6">
            <h2>The pawn (♙,♟)</h2>
            <p>
                Unlike the other pieces, pawns cannot move backwards. Normally a pawn
                moves by advancing a single square, but the first time a pawn moves, it
                has the option of advancing two squares.
